## Introduction
In today's digital age, capturing and sharing memories through images has become an integral part of our lives. PoeticaPic aims to take this experience to the next level by offering users the ability to transform their images into exquisite works of art. By seamlessly blending image filtering, customizable text overlays, and AI-generated narratives, PoeticaPic elevates your photos into lasting memories that evoke emotion and imagination.

## Features
1. **Interactive Image Input**: PoeticaPic provides an intuitive interface for users to upload their images and begin the creative journey.

2. **Customizable Image Editing Options**: Users can choose from a variety of image filters and editing options using the power of the Pillow library, tailoring the visual style of their images.

3. **Text Overlay Variety**: Users have the freedom to overlay their images with motivational quotes, poems, or other forms of text, enhancing the narrative of the images.

4. **AI-powered Image Classification**: PoeticaPic employs an image classification model to identify objects and themes within the uploaded images, generating relevant tags.

5. **Llama2 Creative Writing**: Leveraging the generated tags, PoeticaPic collaborates with the Llama2 model to craft personalized stories or poems, adding depth to the images.

6. **Artistic Presentation**: The generated text is elegantly incorporated into the image, resulting in a visually pleasing design that encapsulates both the image and the accompanying narrative.
